# Django serie

In this serie of articles I explore the power of the Django framework, and also the marvells of Docker containers. As the best way to learn is to develop something, in this repo you'll find a small multiplayer Tic Tac Toe with a bit of machine learning in it. 

Note that is NOT a finished project, it was just createrd to showcase the topics of each post.
